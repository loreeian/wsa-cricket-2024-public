Cricket is one of the most popular sports in the world, yet some of us don’t even know the rules! Which leads us to believe that there is so much potential for Cricket analytics in the US. Why wait for someone else to do it?

While we don’t exactly know what we’re going to work on, we are finding that the different fields have a large impact on the outcome of the match. Surface conditions and ball conditions have a huge impact. We’ll investigate something about this! 

<h3>Setup</h3>
Run the <code>get_files.ipynb</code> Jupyter notebook to download the T20 International cricket match data and organize it into a csv file for analysis.
